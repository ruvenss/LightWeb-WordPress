This *WordPRess* PlugIn catches the event of saving a post, and a categorie and sending the data to your LightWeb Stage Server in real time.

The purpose of this PlugIn is to isolate WordPress as an editor blog only and use the LightWeb as the render of the real website. 

But Why? ... you may ask

- WordPress Attacks are becoming more and more often, the plugins less and less sustainables, and more and more insecure. making WordPress a nightmare after 3 months of being installed.
- With LightWeb and WordPress you keep the best of both worlds, in one side the easynest of editing, and updating articles and pages with non tech people and on the other hand a pure html,css, and JS website without CMS platform.
